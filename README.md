## Dataset
The dataset within this repository contains approximately 8 million bird sightings across the United States, showcasing observations of 1,090 different bird species. 

### Data Sources 

- TheCornellLab Feeder Watch Bird Sightings (2021-2023) - `https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/`
- Ebird.org scrapped images - `https://ebird.org/explore`
- State Boundaries - `https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html`

## Setup

### Docker Setup:
- To spin up application using docker first, run `docker-compose up mongodb`
- Once mongodb container is up and running execute `docker-compose up backend`
- After both containers are created and running successfully, access the application on `http://localhost:3000`
- Use `docker-copose down` to shutdown the containers.

### Manual Setup:
#### Database:
- To create the DB using Database Dump you will need to navigate to `datadump` directory.
- Then you will use command `mongorestore --db flock --restoreDbUsersAndRoles --gzip flock`
- This command will add all the required collections to `flock` DB and MongoDB Users with roles assigned to them.
- You will need to enable the the authorization in `mongod.cfg` and restart the MongoDB Service to add authentication to MongoDB.
- Once the above step is completed you can login to MongoDB using `mongosh --host localhost -u mongoapp -p huMONGOu5 --authenticationDatabase flock` Command.

#### Application:
- To start `Flock & Roll` application navigate to `flocknroll` directory.
- Use `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
- Update Mongoclient to `mongodb://mongoapp:huMONGOu5@localhost:27017/flock` in `flocknroll/expressRoutes/routes.js` file. 
- Create `.env.local` File in `flocknroll` directory
    - Add following Environment Variable for your local development:
        - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- Now use `node server.js` to start the application.
- Once all of the above steps are completed you will be able to access application on `http://localhost:3000`
